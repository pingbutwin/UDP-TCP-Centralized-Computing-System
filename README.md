This Centralized Computing System (CCS) is a Java 8-based server that integrates UDP and TCP protocols to provide simultaneous service discovery and multi-client processing. The implementation focuses on high concurrency, utilizing an ExecutorService and the Runnable interface to handle any number of simultaneous TCP client connections through a multithreaded architecture. Service discovery is managed via DatagramSocket broadcasts, while arithmetic operations like ADD, SUB, MUL, and DIV are handled through persistent ServerSocket connections using basic Java networking classes. Beyond communication, the system maintains global statistics, outputting metrics such as operation counts and sum results to the console every 10 seconds. The project is strictly built for JDK 1.8 compatibility, ensuring robust performance for remote arithmetic tasks in a centralized environment.
